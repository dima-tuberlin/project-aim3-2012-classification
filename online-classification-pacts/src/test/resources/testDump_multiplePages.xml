			<text xml:space="preserve">EasyWriter is a [[word processor]] released when the IBM PC was announced in 1981?; written by Capn Software, I believe, which also produced a version of [[Forth]]; see Byte Magazine, January, 1982, p. 62.

EasyWriter was not received well and was soon replaced by better programs, such as WordStar, which was ported from [[CP/M]]. EasyWriter was probably selected by [[IBM]] in its rush to introduce the IBM PC.
