			<text xml:space="preserve">'''Ethelbert''', king of Kent (b.[[552]] d.[[616]]) was the son of Eormenric whom he succeeded as king of Kent in [[560]] AD 

He attempted at one stage to wrest the position of [[Bretwalda]] from Ceawlin of Wessex but was unsuccesful. His standing was advanced by his marriage with Bertha, daughter of Charibert, king of the [[Franks]], and after Ceawlin's death he succeeded in becoming Bretwalda.

The influence of Bertha, who had brought a Frankish priest with her as chaplain, may have led to the invitation to [[Pope Gregory I]] to send missionaries from Rome.  [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] arrived in Canterbury in 596.  

He was later [[Canonization of Saints|canonised]].
